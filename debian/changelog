rtpproxy (3.1+dev1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Build librtpproxy during package configuration and ship a new
    rtpproxy-dev package with the static archive and public header.
  * Add optional audio and unwind build dependencies required by the
    librtpproxy-enabled build.
  * Split debugging helpers and *_debug modules into the rtpproxy-debug
    binary package.
  * Ship the DTLS gateway and ICE lite modules in their respective
    runtime and debug packages to avoid missing-file warnings.
  * Depend on libsrtp2 during the build so the crypto modules are
    compiled and available for packaging.
  * Enable systemd integration by building against libsystemd-dev and
    configuring with --enable-systemd.
  * Preserve librtpproxy's static archive contents under LTO by appending
    -ffat-lto-objects to the maintainer build flags.
  * Provide a packaged systemd service and default configuration so the
    daemon can be managed with systemd out of the box.
