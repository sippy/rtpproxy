rtpproxy (3.1+dev1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Build librtpproxy during package configuration and ship a new
    rtpproxy-dev package with the static archive and public header.
  * Add optional audio and unwind build dependencies required by the
    librtpproxy-enabled build.
  * Split debugging helpers and *_debug modules into the rtpproxy-debug
    binary package.
  * Ship the DTLS gateway and ICE lite modules in their respective
    runtime and debug packages to avoid missing-file warnings.
  * Depend on libsrtp2 during the build so the crypto modules are
    compiled and available for packaging.
  * Enable systemd integration by building against libsystemd-dev and
    configuring with --enable-systemd.
  * Preserve librtpproxy's static archive contents under LTO by appending
    -ffat-lto-objects to the maintainer build flags.
  * Reuse the upstream systemd service and socket units in Debian builds,
    installing their shared sysconfig file for consistent configuration.
  * Update the systemd service to supervise rtpproxy via systemd sockets
    so the packaged unit works with Type=notify without extra tuning.
  * Create a dedicated rtpproxy user and group at install time so the
    service runs under a locked-down account by default.
  * Align the packaged systemd unit with /run paths so PID tracking stays
    consistent with RuntimeDirectory management.
  * Use systemd's MAINPID in ExecStart for the pidfile flag instead of
    hardcoding the /run directory path.
