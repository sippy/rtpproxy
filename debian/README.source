Building the Debian packaging helpers locally requires the Debian helper tools.

Before invoking commands such as `debian/rules clean` or `dpkg-buildpackage`,
install the packaging toolchain, for example:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install debhelper
```

The packaging workflow in CI already provisions these dependencies. When
working on the packaging locally you need to provision them once per build
environment.
