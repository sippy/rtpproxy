# Command-line options passed to rtpproxy by the systemd unit.
#
# The service already enables foreground operation and manages the runtime
# directory, so typically only the control socket and advertised addresses
# need to be provided here. For example:
#   OPTIONS="-s udp:127.0.0.1:7722 -l 203.0.113.10/198.51.100.10"
#
# Leave the value empty to accept the built-in defaults.
# The packaged default listens on all available addresses.
OPTIONS="-l *"
